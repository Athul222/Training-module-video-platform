# Training Module Videos Platform

## Objective

This a Training Module Videos Platform for the employees to watch video content in sequence, with specific requirements created using React framework.

## Overview

In this module I've created a well interactive user interface with minimal complexity. The web page contains the video and its corresponding description about the importance of it. The video section contains play, pause, skip backward and video volume controller. Even though there will be a fast forward button, its functionality is completely disabled so there will be no skipping. Below the video section a arrow button would be available which performs go to the next video module.
